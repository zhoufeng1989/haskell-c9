There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are
obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious
deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.

##difference between most current languages(imperative) and haskell (functional)##

  Most current languages(Java, C++, C#) are closely linked to the underlying hardware, in the sense that
programming is based upon the idea of **changing stored values**. In contrast,
Haskell promotes a more abstract style of programming, based upon the idea
of **applying functions to arguments**.
