# Charpter1 Introduction

a **function** is a mapping that takes one or more arguments and produces a signle result.

**function apply and substitution model**  
When a function is applied to actual arguments, the result is obtained by
substituting these arguments into the body of the function in place of the
argument names. This process may immediately produce a result that cannot
be further simplified, such as a number.
