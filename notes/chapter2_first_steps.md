#chapter2 First steps

**function application** has high order priority than all other operators. for example ``` f a + b``` means ```(f a) + b```. 

**function naming requirements**  
When defining a new function, the names of the function and its arguments
must begin with a lower-case letter, but can then be followed by zero or more letters (both lower- and upper-case), digits, underscores, and forward single
quotes.

**the layout rule**  
Within a script, each definition must begin in precisely the same column. This 
layout rule makes it possible to determine the grouping of definitions from
their indentation.

**comments**  
**Ordinary comments** begin with the symbol -- and extend to the end of the current line  
**Nested comments** begin and end with the symbols {- and -}, may span multiple lines, and may be nested in the sense that comments can contain other comments.
